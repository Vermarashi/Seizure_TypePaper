# Seizure_2
##Differential Transcript Expression and RNA Splicing to Distinguish Seizure Type

These scripts are to be used on data present in the paper. These scripts were u used for quantifiaction, abundance, count matrix generation, differential expression and isoform switch analysis. These scripts are designed to run on bam files.

To successfully run these script, organize following input files including scripts in project folder.
1.	Bam_files: This folder should contain the BAM files that are essential for the analysis.
2.	05_Stringtie2countMatrix.sh: This shell script is integral to the initial steps of the analysis and will generate the gene_count_matrix and transcript_count_matrix.
3.	Python_script (prepDE.py) (download from https://github.com/gpertea/stringtie/blob/master/prepDE.py)

Script are called with
bash Stringtie2countMatrix.sh
which used bam files as input and generate the necessary output like count matrices (gene_count_matrix and transcript_count_matrix) using prepDE.py script.

06_SeizureType_DTE and 07_SeizureType_Transcript usage were used for differential transcript expression and isoform switch analysis. Both the scripts used expression data generated by "05_Stringtie2countMatrix.sh" script. 

08_Seizure_Type_Prediction_modelling.R was used for prediction modelling.
 
The scripts for quality check, trimming and alignment are available at https://github.com/rob-meller/SeizurePaper_1.
